# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
An initial glance through the information reveals a small number of misspelled names, including extra characters, and missing positions.
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.
Module 4 - Converting CSV files to a Pandas Dataframe

## Database Storage
TO BE DETERMINED is the database we intend to use, and we will integrate Flask to display the data. 
Module 9 - Flask, SQLAlchemy

## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier. We will perform logistic regression on the points results for the last 3 seasons by role and by player to predict the points for each for the upcoming season. 
Module 17 - Supervised Machine Learning

We can use different machine learning algorithms and compare them against each other, although getting one to work would be great.  

## Dashboard
In addition to using a Flask template, we will also integrate D3.js for a fully functioning and interactive dashboard. It will be hosted on TO BE DETERMINED (AWS?).
Module 11, 12, 13 - Flask, jsonify
