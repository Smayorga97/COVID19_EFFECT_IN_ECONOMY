## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier. We will perform linear regression on the points results for the last 3 seasons by role and by player to predict the points for each for the upcoming season. We can use different machine learning algorithms and compare them against each other, although getting one to work would be great.
