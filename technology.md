# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

## Database Storage
TO BE DETERMINED is the database we intend to use, and we will integrate Flask to display the data. 

## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier. We will perform logistic regression on the points results for the last 3 seasons by role and by player to predict the points for each for the upcoming season.  

## Dashboard
In addition to using a Flask template, we will also integrate D3.js for a fully functioning and interactive dashboard. It will be hosted on TO BE DETERMINED.
