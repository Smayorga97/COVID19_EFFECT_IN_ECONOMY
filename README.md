# Predicting 2022 Fantasy Football Picks by Role Using Machine Learning
by Albert Yee, Krzysztof Grabka, Santiago Mayorga, Sheela Tookhy, Soumya Bhardwaj, and Sunil Khambaita (TA)

## Topic 
It is estimated that over 40 million individuals play fantasy football (as of August 2021). Per Yahoo Finance, it is an industry expected to grow by $6.1 billion by 2026. Although the 2022 fantasy football pick season has already passed, we hope to answer if we could use machine learning to help predict the best players to pick for each role, as if simulating the draft at the start of a season.  

## Source Datasets
While there are many websites filled with football stats out there, few offer information for free. We were not interested in current season data for our analysis, although we may consider comparing our results against current season results to see how accurate our predictions were. We retrieved our data from the website [Pro Football Reference](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/). 

CSV files of historical data on player stats for passing, rushing, and receiving yards were downloaded and are located in the DATA_SETS directory. For our analysis, we used the standard PPR league scoring system. In the downloaded CSV files, a column was added to manually calculate that player's fantasy points for that category. The points and data from the nine separate CSV files will be joined by player name, and points from each category will be added together to determine total fantasy points per player per year.
